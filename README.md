**Information Analysis | University of Michigan School of Information ’27**

I am an Information Analysis student-athlete focused on Analytics Engineering for Technical Teams.

My goal is to support silicon engineering teams by building the "metrics infrastructure" they need to track progress. I leverage SQL and Python to transform messy, raw datasets into clean, actionable insights that enable engineering teams to evaluate design quality and schedule risk.

### Technical Competencies
| Domain | Stack & Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Data Engineering (ETL)** | **Python**: ingestion (`requests`/JSON), transformation, incremental loading, deduplication logic. |
| **Data Modeling & SQL** | **SQL (SQLite / PostgreSQL)**: normalized schemas, constraints, JOIN-based analytics and aggregation patterns. |
| **Systems Telemetry** | Sensor/log ingestion → timestamped metrics for analysis (implemented via **Python + LibreHardwareMonitor / psutil**). |
| **Visualization & Reporting** | **Matplotlib / Tableau**: KPI dashboards, trendlines, and status reporting. |

### Leadership & Drive
- **High Performance:** Division 1 Sprinter (University of Michigan). School Record Holder (4x100m). I bring the same discipline to data quality and execution.
- **Process Improvement:** Co-President, *Black Student Athlete Alliance*. Implemented centralized inventory tracking to improve operational organization.
