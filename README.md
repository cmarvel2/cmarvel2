# Corey Royster
**Engineering Metrics & Reporting (SQL / Python) | University of Michigan (UMSI ’27)**

Hello My name is Corey royster I enjoy building data pipelines and reporting layers that simulate helping technical teams track progress, surface risk, and standardize metrics.
The current focus of my personal projects are turning messy raw signals (telemetry + external datasets) into clean, queryable tables that power visualizations.

## What I Build
- **Metrics pipelines:** ingestion → validation → normalization → append-only history for trend analysis
- **SQL reporting layers:** reusable queries/views for consistent engineering metrics and progress tracking
- **Dashboards:** operational views that support decisions (progress, anomalies, schedule risk signals)

## Skills
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite  
- **Reporting & Tools:** Power BI, Excel, Git/GitHub
