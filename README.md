# Corey Royster
Analytics Engineering (Python / SQL) | University of Michigan (UMSI ’27)

## Hello, I’m Corey Royster

I’m an Information Analysis student with a strong interest in hardware performance analysis, focused on how data can make technical work easier to track, explain, and improve. I like building systems that take noisy, inconsistent inputs and turn them into structured tables and clear views that help answer practical questions like: what changed, where risk is building, and what’s trending over time.

Right now, my work centers on two things:
1) collecting CPU/GPU/memory performance signals and shaping them into consistent snapshots, and  
2) building repeatable ingestion workflows that support SQL analysis and reporting.

## What I Do

### Data Collection and Standardization  
Collecting and transforming raw data into predictable, comparable records. This includes defining consistent fields, handling missing or inconsistent values, and building snapshots that stay stable across repeated runs.

### Data Modeling and SQL Analysis  
Designing schemas that support clean joins and trend analysis (dimension-style tables when it helps), then writing SQL that turns raw records into interpretable outputs.

### Reporting and Visualization  
Producing views that communicate what’s happening clearly—either through dashboards (Power BI) or lightweight plotted summaries when the goal is quick validation and exploration.
