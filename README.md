# Corey Royster
**Engineering Metrics & Reporting (SQL / Python) | University of Michigan (UMSI ’27)**

I build data pipelines and reporting layers that help technical teams track progress, surface risk, and standardize metrics.
Current focus: turning messy raw signals (telemetry + external datasets) into clean, queryable tables that power reliable dashboards.

## What I Build
- **Metrics pipelines:** ingestion → validation → normalization → append-only history for trend analysis
- **SQL reporting layers:** reusable queries/views for consistent engineering metrics and progress tracking
- **Dashboards:** operational views that support decisions (progress, anomalies, schedule risk signals)

## Skills
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite  
- **Reporting & Tools:** Power BI, Excel, Git/GitHub  

## Leadership
- Division 1 Sprinter (Michigan Track & Field); school record-holder (4x100m relay)
- Co-President, Black Student Athlete Alliance: implemented inventory tracking to improve operational execution
